// using breakpoint is a great apporch espacially for loops where we can monitor each and every itrearion

// ex:
for(let i = 0 ; i < 9  ; i++){
    debugger; // this will works everywhere may be
    console.log(i);
    // this red dot will either work if we code on browser itself or we run this code as we did in JAVA
}
