JavaScript is a high level multi-pradigm prototype based object oriented 
interpreted or just in time complied dynamic single threaded garbage 
collecting language with first-class functions with a non blocking event 
loop concurrency model

High level : High level is reffered as programming language that does not 
require us to define the memory allocation process and that all be 
abstracted for user Such as JavaScript, python C++ ,java etc

multi-pradigm : this means the programming approach supported by language 
here in this case it is multiple such as :  Object oriented programming
                                            functional programming
                                            Procedural programming

garbage collecting : automatically removes unused objects that make it lot better

interpreted or just in time complied : as we know interpreter executes a line by line that makes it slow so, JIT is used which works as a complier and interpretes the all code at once by as in complier the complied files need to executes and that may consume a lil bit of time here not this is
Jit executes files directly

        complier -> complied file -> executes
        JIT -> executes

and JIT coverting file repeatedly line by line after execution of program to maintain its quality

first class functions : reffered as functions that can be stored as vairiables

dynamic : no need to define datatype and can be converted in future

single-threaded : works only main thread here

non blocking event loop : here js executes long running task in backgroud after there completion they are added back in main thread
