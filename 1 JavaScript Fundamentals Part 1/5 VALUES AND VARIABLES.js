            let 1Name = 'Name' // ❌❌❌
            let name-1 = 'Name' // ❌❌❌
            let name first = 'Name' // ❌❌❌
            let Name = 'Name' // can bet used but not a good practice as camelcase isn't followed
            let a = 'Name' // not a good approch as the variable name doen't define which type of value is stored
